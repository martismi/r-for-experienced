# r-for-stats
Introduction to R for people already familiar with basic statistics. These scripts skip a lot of explanations and assume the user has basic knowledge of concepts like datasets, variables, measurement levels. 

Some of the datasets are taken from 
https://github.com/martigso/stv1020R/tree/master/data
and scripts 1 and 2 are partly/mostly just translated from Martin's originals in Norwegian.
